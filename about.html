        The purpose of our site is to encourage and support students in budgeting their points.
         Just input your points through <a href="https://wesleyan-sp.transactcampus.com/eaccounts/(S(o2u5ivncjnjzvcpsccto1fr2))/AnonymousHome.aspx">eAccounts</a>
        and you can easily create a weekly budget and factor in which purchases 
        would allow you to stick to your predetermined budget all through the site! 
        Simply swipe and our app will update your profile with how many points
         you've spent and how much it deviates from your budget.
